As more and more new phones hit the market, they bring with them a vast arrange of new features and functions. If you're looking for the latest mobiles that are going to be launched this year, you should have a look at [Upcoming Phones](https://www.upcomingphones.in/). We've listed some of the most popular here.

**Text Messaging (SMS)**: This allows you to send short messages from one mobile phone to another. Although all modern handsets will have a text facility, the ease of which you can write messages will vary widely between phones.

**Colour Screen**: Although this isn't essential, a colour screen can look good, and makes text clearer to read.

**Design**: Many mobile phones have a fold-down front panel or a central hinge. This type of design, (often called a clam shell or a flip phone), enables manufacturers to produce smaller handsets. In addition, the flip-open design can protect the phone's screen from being damaged, stops you from accidentally pressing keys and makes it easier to answer calls.

**Band Type**: Handsets will be dual-, tri- or quad-band, depending on the range of frequencies they can operate on. A dual band (900 and 1800 MHz) phone will work almost anywhere in the world, but you will need a tri-band phone (900, 1800 and 1900 MHz) if you're visiting North or South America. A few other countries such as Ecuador, St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, and Turks and Caicos Islands require a quad-band phone (850, 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz).

**3G**: These phones allow you watch video clips, live footage, send moving pictures and download 3D games. There's also an 'always on' internet access, video-conferencing capabilities, and interactive application sharing.

**Built-in Camera**: A camera can be a great way of keeping touch, whether it's to show your workmates the gorgeous beach you're relaxing on, or to ask a friend if they like the pair of shoes you're about to buy.

**Vibrating Alert**: This lets you know that your phone is ringing, even when its noisy. It also allows you to turn your ringer off in quiet environments.

**WAP**: Wireless Application Protocol, letting you to access internet information services on the move.

**GPRS**: This will give you an "always on" data connection that can operate at speeds similar to fixed line modems. You will be charged for the amount of data you use, rather that the length of time you're connected for.

**Address Book Lookup**: If you add contact details into your address book, your phone will display the name of the person who's calling. Although all phones have this feature, some make it easier to find entries than others, and some can only store information in the SIM card, rather than the phone itself. This feature may also allow you to assign different ringing tones to certain people or groups, so that you know who is calling without looking at your phone.

**Voice Dialling**: A feature that allows you to dial a contact by simply pressing one button and saying their name.

**Call Logs**: These logs will give you a detailed record of the last calls made and received, often with time and date stamps.

**Data Support**: Some phones will allow you to connect to a computer to upload or download information. You can synchronise your contact details and organiser contents to keep the information consistent across all your devices, or simply as a backup method in case you lose your phone. Connectivity can be either wireless such as with Bluetooth or through a cable.

**Music**: Phones will often have the capability of playing MP3 files or to act as an FM radio.
Infra-red and Bluetooth Communication: This capability is useful for data connections. Bluetooth can also be used to connect to car kits or personal headsets.

**Polyphonic Ringtones**: This allows your phone to play music consisting a number of instruments. Depending on the phone, you can download new polyphonic ringtones or even compose them yourself.
